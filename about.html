                <p>Hi there,</p>
                <p><strong>I'm Garima, and this is the story of how PlanO came to be—a journey that started with the life-changing experience of becoming a mom.</strong></p>

                <p>I thought I was ready. I devoured every parenting book, followed all the "experts" on social media, and subscribed to every parenting website. I was armed with knowledge, prepared for anything... or so I naively believed.</p>

                <p class="wrap-text">But motherhood is a crash course in humility. No amount of pre-baby prep truly prepares you for the overwhelming, exhausting, and exhilarating reality of raising a tiny human. Suddenly, I was juggling a demanding career, a whirlwind of a child, and the remnants of a social life—all while fueled by caffeine and sheer willpower.</p>

                </div>
                </div>
                
                <div class="aboutus-full-text">
                <p>Then came the dreaded "terrible twos," and with them, a new parental obsession: finding the perfect activities to nurture my son's curiosity and development. What began as a simple search quickly spiraled into a full-time job. Hours melted away scrolling through Google, trying to figure out what a 2-year-old could even learn, then searching for classes nearby, hunting down reviews... it was a nightmare!</p>

                <p>In a world where technology has connected us and AI is reshaping industries, the kids' activity space felt stuck in the past. I was relying on <strong>word-of-mouth—word-of-mouth!</strong>—to find a decent class. Even after enrolling my child, the scheduling, the sign-ups, the frantic manual calendar entries… it was a constant, low-hum of stress.</p>

                <p>Somewhere between a maze of browser tabs and sticky notes, it hit me: <strong>There had to be a better way.</strong></p>

                <p>✨ <strong>And that’s how PlanO was born.</strong></p>

                <p>PlanO isn’t just an app; it’s a lifeline for parents. It’s about unlocking the best opportunities for our children—making it ridiculously easy to discover, book, and manage all their activities in one beautifully simple place.</p>

                <p>But more than that, I want PlanO to be a <strong>trusted partner for parents</strong>, a tool that brings a little sanity back into our already chaotic lives.</p>

                <p><strong>This isn’t just a business—it’s a mission.</strong> I’m building PlanO for every parent who has ever felt overwhelmed, for every child who deserves access to enriching experiences, and for a future where technology truly helps us raise our kids.</p>

                <p><strong>I'm incredibly excited to share this journey with you.</strong> Join me—let’s make parenting just a little easier, together.</p>

                <p>- <strong>Garima</strong></p>
